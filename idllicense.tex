\section{Getting your own copy of IDL}

\subsection{1} Download the IDL 8.2 software from

\url{http://www.exelisvis.com/Downloads/ProductDownloads.aspx}

which requires that you create an account on that page and then follow up.  The
company (Exelis VS) will send you an email of confirmation with a web link that
you need to click.

If you don't seem to get that Exelis email, it is usually because
your email program mistakenly routed it to your “Junk” or “Spam” mailbox;
you should check those mailboxes.

After confirming the new Exelis account from that email, it takes from
2 to 72 hours (depending on time of day, weekends, holidays, and planetary
alignment) for the new account to be approved and become active.  At that
point, it is possible to log on (again) to the above site and actually be able
to use the “Download IDL” link.


\subsection{2} Once IDL is downloaded \& installed on a computer, you can
use it to determine the computer's unique “host ID” which is needed for
generating a license file.   Instructions about this will be sent to each
student.

You should have received the following e-mail:

For use with ASTR 2600, OIT is waiving the usual \$15 fee so that you can get a free IDL license for your computer.  See

\url{http://spot.colorado.edu/~sitelic/idl/request/2600/}   \emph{NOTE: You must request a license by October 5th}

for instructions about how to download the software onto your personal computer, and for a simple request form for a license.

The size of the IDL 8.2 package you must download is about 500MB.

When I get your request, I use the information (hostID, OS, hostname) to
generate and email a special license file. You can copy/paste the text of the
license into the IDL License Wizard window, and start using IDL.
