\section{Tutorial: Structures}

To prepare for your homework and get accustomed to making structures, we'll
make some structures that closely follow the examples in lecture.

Do this work in your \verb|~/ASTR2600/tutorials| directory, and add the results
to git.

First, open a file called \verb|CarStruct__DEFINE.pro|.  In it, create a structure definition.
\begin{lstlisting}
pro CarStruct__DEFINE
    dummycar = {CarStruct,
        miles: 0L}
end
\end{lstlisting}

Then, in IDL, create an instance of a \verb|CarStruct|:\\
\verb|car = {CarStruct}|

And set its mileage:\\
\verb|car.miles = 300|

Now let's change the \verb|CarStruct| definition.  Add a new field called
\verb|year| to the structure definition.

Once you've done this, make 5 cars with the following properties:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
car1: 25000 miles, 2005
car2: 225000 miles, 1987
car3: 100000 miles, 2002
car4: 19000 miles, 1995
car5: 28000 miles, 2007
\end{lstlisting}

Plot the miles driven versus the year of the cars.  You should probably make an
array of these cars in order to do this.  Use a reasonable plot symbol (i.e.,
don't use lines).

\section{Thinking about Data}
For this exercise, you'll only need paper, at least to start.

If you were making a database of people, focusing on their contact information
(address, phone number, etc.), how would you do it?  What properties should a
person have?  At the very least, they should have a name, phone number, and
address, but you could add more.  

Which of these properties can be broken down?  Think about addresses in
particular: they consist of different parts: street, zip code, city.

How would you express these as a hierarchy?  Draw a diagram illustrating the
relationship between structures for a single person in your contact list.  
Think about how you might implement this in IDL; you can write it out with
pseudo-code if you're up to it.
